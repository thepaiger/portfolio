      <p>Hi there! My name is Paige, and I am a developer with a love for problem-solving, minute details, and working with a variety of technologies. When faced with a complex problem, I strive to understand the team's priorities, design a solution, then optimize workflows and create clear documentation for processes. The opportunity to combine engineering with my creative background is what excites me most, and with my strong client-focused background, I am highly driven and thrive under pressure.</p>
